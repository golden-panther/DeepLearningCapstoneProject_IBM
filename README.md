'Applied Deep Learning Capstone Project' by IBM on edX

I have built a Keras model which classifies 7 different currency notes(european) using their image as input. 
I have used the ResNet50 and VGG16 models for training. 
VGG16 achieved approximately 98 percent accuracy on 5 epochs. I have used the cognitiveclass.ai labs as the workspace.
